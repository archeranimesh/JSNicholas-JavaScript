# Safari Book | Professional: JavaScript® for Web Developers, Third Edition #
## By: Nicholas C. Zakas ##


I am following the [Safari Book's Professional: JavaScript® for Web Developers, Third Edition](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/professional-javascript-for/9781118026694// "Professional: JavaScript® for Web Developers, Third Edition"), and will try to finish all the course under this track to increase my understanding of the JavaScript language. I am not aware of any copyright issues, but will upload in [my Github profile](https://github.com/archeranimesh/) for the version control on my study.

This is a notes taking repository which will have code and my understanding of the course. Kindly mail me if there an issue with copyright will try to remove it.
